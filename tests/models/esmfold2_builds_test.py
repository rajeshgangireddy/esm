"""ESMFold2 build configurations.

The axes a user can turn without changing the weights: kernel backend, chunk
size, flash-attention, device, precision and ``torch.compile``. Every case here
either asserts a *structural* fact about the module tree (which is what makes
``set_kernel_backend`` testable without a GPU) or holds a build against the
CPU / fp32 result - never against itself, because a build compared to its own
output passes when the whole configuration drifts together.

Two axes are deliberately absent. Context parallelism needs a ``distributed/``
tree this package does not ship. Backbone precision needs a bundled backbone, and
the tiny configs have none (``model.esmc is None``), so bf16 / fp32 / fp8
selection has no module to act on; it belongs with the published-weight tests.

Defects this file pins:

- ``set_kernel_backend`` never reaches ``msa_encoder``, so an MSA-enabled
  checkpoint runs four triangle multiplications on whatever backend they were
  constructed with. ``set_chunk_size`` on the release model does reach them.
- ``EsmFold2ExperimentalModel.set_chunk_size`` misses ``msa_encoder`` too.
- ``apply_torch_compile`` enforces its "does NOT stack with our Triton kernels"
  docstring: it inspects ``_kernel_backend`` and refuses a fused build rather
  than letting Inductor fail deep in the backend.

Each is a strict ``xfail`` or an explicit expectation, so a fix flips the test
rather than going unnoticed.

Compiled-vs-eager equivalence is deliberately not asserted here.
``apply_torch_compile`` does not behave the same way on every GPU: the CI runner
compiles in both modes and reproduces eager, while our L40 and H100 boxes die in
Inductor with ``PendingUnbackedSymbolNotFound``. Neither outcome can be pinned
without making one platform's behaviour everyone's expectation, and this suite
has no tier that runs outside the required gates. Only the *refusal* to stack
with the fused backend is tested, which needs no GPU.

# fp32, and that dominates.
#
# Observed at L=197, first the floor (two eager CUDA runs, so only CUDA's own
# reduction-order nondeterminism separates them), then the worst case across all
# seven GPU_BUILDS:

# flash flag barely move it, the device does. So only the coordinates are worth
# asserting, and the other three are each excluded for a recorded reason.
#
# ``distogram_logits``: 2.44 is half its own range (|x| <= 5.07), so an untrained
# one-loop trunk in bf16 does not reproduce its fp32 self and a bound wide enough
# to pass would assert nothing.
#
# ``pae``: discontinuous in the coordinates - ``ConfidenceHead`` bins pairwise
# distances and looks the bin up in ``dist_bin_pairwise_embed``, so a shift
# across a bin edge moves a logit by a whole embedding row. It tracks the
# coordinate difference rather than the build.
#
# ``plddt``: ``ConfidenceHead.plddt_weight`` is zero-initialised, so on a
# random-weight model pLDDT is 0.5 everywhere on every device. Exactly 0.0 is a
# vacuous pass.
